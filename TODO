Design decisions:
  - Photo library has to reside in a single director, but no specific folder structure inside is imposed
    Reasons:
      - easy to access photos even without the software
      - easy to move library to a different location
      - "importing" is as easy as copying the files to the correct location
  - Arbitrary kinds of tags (e.g. people, places, but really anything user-defined), arbitrary tag values per kind
    - values of tags are defined dynamically by assigning them for the first time
  - Keep reference to raw file around
  - Allow multiple versions of the same picture (original, post-processed), grouped together
  - Fast and efficient to use

Main features:
  Foto store:
    ☐ decide on a on-disk format
    ☐ enumerate all photos in store on startup
    ☐ read metadata
      ☐ EXIF
      ☐ XMP (?)
    ☐ display RAW thumbnail
    ☐ search for duplicates (how to deal with duplicates?)
    ☐ allow moving photos around

  Tagging:
    ☐ manage tag kinds
    ☐ allow assigning tags to pictures (auto-completion of existing values for the current tag kind)
    ☐ allow easy (from the usability perspective) and efficient (from the implementation perspective) renaming of tag kinds and values

  Search:
    ☐ search by tag
    ☐ search by time
    ☐ search by location (?)
