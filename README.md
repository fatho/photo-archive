# Photo Archive

*A SQLite based photo archival system written in Rust and TypeScript.*

The application consists of a command line application for maintaining the photo database (scanning photos, generating thumbnails) with a built-in web server that provides a (still limited) REST API for viewing the database and a frontend developed in Typescript.

## Build instructions

The application is written in Rust 1.37 and TypeScript 3.6 (other version might also work).
The following dependencies are needed for building:
- Rust 1.37
- Cargo
- TypeScript 3.6
- Browserify (for turning the JS generated by TypeScript into something that is usable in a browser)
- Inkscape (for rasterizing the favicon)
- ImageMagick (for converting png to ico)

## Usage

The command line application is called `photoctl`. It automatically tries to detect the location of the users photo library based on platform specific mechanisms, but it can also be explicitly overriden.

The most important commands are the following:

```bash
# Scanning the library
photoctl photos scan

# Generating thumbnails (for the web frontend)
photoctl thumbnails generate

# Start a webserver, listening on http://localhost:8076 by default
photoctl browse

# Discovering more functionality and customizable options
photoctl --help
photoctl photos --help
# ...
```
